<p id="description">Travels through different rooms of a house to transport things and forward messages; can also show weather (API) time even Pomodoro and check previous messages. Messages will be through the touchscreen keyboard; it'll keep displaying it until it reaches a specific room or destination. All through swiping the touchscreen it opens different screens and I can add more things in the future whatever I miss. It's kind of a personal assistant but on wheels.</p>
